        <p>HTML is a markup language and its main role is to give meaning and structure to the web page. CSS stands for cascading styles sheet, used to give depth and styles and over all beautify the contents of the html structure. JavaScript is considered a true programming language. HTML is a markup language that gives meaning to the different elements on the page and builds a structure, CSS is used to design to structure and beautify the page and JavaScript helps with letting the user interact with the web page. The building blocks of HTML are elements,tags and attributes. An attribute adds value to the element. it isn't necessary to add an attribute inside every tag, however adding an attribute gives more meaning and individuality to an element. Elements are the basic building blocks of HTML and gives the content meaning. An element will be wrapped between < and > brackets these are called tags. the content is placed between an opening and closing tag. An attribute adds value to the element. it is placed within the opening tag of the element. Eg <p href = "www.google.com"> Google </p> from the example we see that the p is the paragraph element used. href(hyperlink reference) is the attribute that opens up google.com when the content is clicked on. all the visible content should go inside the opening and closing tag. a self closing tag is the tag that doesn't require a closing tag and closes it on its own, it gets its content from the attribute within it. example for a self closing tag is the <img> tag. indenting is considered a good practice as it improves the readability of the code and gives us clarity on the nesting elements. between the opening and the closing tab is the content that is google.</p>
